        <p>`Once upon a time in a village named Mahabaleshwar there lived a family of 3 members. The name of the father is Balwath singh and mother name is Ambaveda and son is Yashwanth. Balwath singh always scolds Yashwanth to study because he always waste time by spending his day with his friends. As he scolds the son, Yashwanth became anger and shouted the father that he is not interested in studies, he just want to enjoy his life as his father is rich enough. After sometime Ambaveda came near Balwath singh and discussed about the future of Yashwanth. Ambaveda said that there was an aashram where the education can be made extraordinary. And the aashram was look after by Vishnu aacharya. Parents are decided to join him in the aashram. Mother convinced son to join in the aashram.
            Next day father along with his son reached the aashram and talked to aacharya. He speaks to Yashwanth and feel that he is good in manner. After sometime aacharya speak with Balwath personally and says to acharya that he is lazy and indiscipline, and faher pleased acharya to look after him for his better future. The very next morning traning starts with Yashwanth and acharya’s son Aditya. Acharya gives work to read sloka and Yashwanth refuses to read the sloka and he receives punishment from Guru. It will continue for more than couple of days. Yashwanth feels that Guru is not loving him and he was forced to read the slokas. And the days went same for some days.
              One day Guru and his wife want to attend marriage so they gave responsibility to look after the child to Yashwanth that Aditya should learn slokas without going out. Yashwanth tried to make him study but Aditya didn’t listened to Yashwanth’s words and in his anger he bet Aditya, and Aditya Sat and learning slokas. Afer arriving of Aditya parents he complains about Yashwanth manhandling. Mother Lakshmi scolds Yashwanth for his behaviour but Guru will support Yashwanth and says that as I gave responsibility he did his work. At that time Yashwanth also realizes his mistakes and day by day he improves his education and completes his education. He go back to his home and take all the family responsibilities and he wanted to make his parents more happier
